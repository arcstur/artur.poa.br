Hello! I'm Artur, a curious brazilian born and raised in Porto Alegre.

## Math teacher and software developer

Since my adolescence, I had been giving private classes in Mathematics and Physics to classmates, neighbours and people-alike. In university, I graduated in Mathematics at [UFRGS](https://www.ufrgs.br/site/). I even used to run a YouTube channel giving lessons on Mathematics questions for the Brazilian exam ENEM.

I learned programming by myself and therefore, as a teacher, I used to write python scripts to support me in my math classes. Then, when I left my current teaching job in 2022, I started working professionally as a software developer. Until now, I've been mostly working with web development using Django, Flask, React and data analysis with Pandas.

I also run a homelab with a bunch of self-hosted software, like Nextcloud, using NixOS for a declarative environment, because I'm one of those nerds.

## Linguistics Olympiads

After I represented Brazil in the [International Linguistics Olympiad 2018](https://ioling.org/participants/2018), I joined the [Brazilian Linguistics Olympiad](https://obling.org/) volunteer team, becoming a coordinator in 2022. I started mainly focusing on composing problems and grading papers, gradually going to a place of making the technical and logistical part of the olympiad work well. The olympiad has two phases and a in-person event for the finalists. We also organized the [International Linguistics Olympiad 2024](https://iol2024.org/), which was the first edition to happen in the southern hemisphere.

## Free software enthusiast

Since 2019 I've been running Linux on my laptop. A university friend helped me install and I never stopped caring and promoting free software since then. I always prefer using free software in my personal life and wherever I go, trying to spread the free-software-virus along the way.

## Wikimedian

My journey on the Wikimedia Movement started when I created a project in the Brazilian Linguistics Olympiad: [Obelepédia](https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Obelep%C3%A9dia), in 2021. This project was an edit-a-thon activity for the olympiad finalists, in which each student writes a complete article in the Portuguese Wikipedia about one language of the world. This fueled my Wikipedia editing and launched me inside the Wikimedia Movement.

I got to know [Wikimedia Brasil](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Brasil) in 2022, when I participated in the first Brazilian national wikimedia conference. In 2023, I participated in [Calibra](https://pt.wikiversity.org/wiki/Calibra), a Brazilian leadership development program organized by Wikimedia Brasil. We formed a network of enthusiastic wikimedian organizers called Organize!. My project was a Wikidata edit-a-thon realized in the International Linguistics Olympiad 2024.

In 2024 I worked professionally for Wikimedia Brasil as a software developer, building [QuickStatements 3.0](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/QuickStatements_3.0), a very popular free software for the Wikidata ecosystem that helps people perform multiple Wikidata edits at once, in batches.

In 2025, I entered Wikimedia Brasil's volunteer members and became a [Project Assistant](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:ACorr%C3%AAa_(WMB)) in the professional staff. As a Project Assistant in the Education and Technology areas, among other things, I do workshops for university teachers and students, collaborate on cultural collections data and mass upload, develop free tools for the ecosystem, and organize local events.

## Veganism

I became vegan in 2021, using the 2020 pandemic year as my transition year. Since my adolescence, I was very fond of vegetarianism but never actually started the shift. Then, as my mom and I were spending more time at home, we had more time to cook and to learn about veganism. In 2025, I entered [Mercy For Animal's](https://mercyforanimals.org.br/) volunteer capacity, an international NGO promoting the end of animal suffering through legal campaigns, advocacy and public actions.

## Mate

Although I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, the gaúcho capital, I only developed the habit of drinking mate around 2023. I remember being scared as a child as I drank an almost boiling mate and burned my mouth. After a friend shared a well made mate with me, I never stopped drinking it almost every day. I like to use creative and different gourds, my favorite is a square-ish-octagonal one, also called "geometrical mate".
